# Synacor Challenge
The goal is to build a virtual machine that can run instruction code according to a specification found in the problem statement.

With the problem statement is attached a program to run.

 ### Completion
The challenge has 8 pregress checkpoints. These are alpha-numerical codes that can be submitted and validated in the challenge website.
So far I've reached 3 of them:
- The first one is given in the problem statement.
- The second one is given by the provided program once the OUT instruction is implemented.
- The third one is given by the provided program once the entire instruction set is implemented.

The provided program appears to be a text adventure, so I'm currently working under the assumption that further codes will be obtainened by playing the game.

### Features
- The VM is fully implemented and the program runs without any issues so far.
- It also has a debug mode where the state of the machine is printed every step.
- An assembler is also implemented to convert a rudimentary assembly language into bytecode. A couple of sample programs can be found in the `programs` directory.
